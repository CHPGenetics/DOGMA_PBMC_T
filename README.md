## Overview

In this study, we employed DOGMA-seq to perform single-cell multi-omic profiling of T cells under various stimulation conditions, including PGE2, TGF-β, and combinations of IL-1B and IL-23. By integrating RNA, ADT, and ATAC data, we characterized transcriptional and chromatin accessibility changes across different states of T cell activation. Additionally, we integrated these molecular findings with existing Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data to investigate potential regulatory mechanisms underlying IBD.
